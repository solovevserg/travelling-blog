            Travel is the movement of people between distant geographical locations. Travel can be done by foot,
            bicycle,
            automobile, train, boat, bus, airplane, ship or other means, with or without luggage, and can be one way or
            round
            trip. Travel can also include relatively short stays between successive movements.

        <h2>Etymology</h2>
        <p>
            The origin of the word "travel" is most likely lost to history. The term "travel" may originate from the Old
            French word travail, which means 'work'. According to the <b>Merriam Webster</b> dictionary, the first known
            use
            of the word travel was in the 14th century. It also states that the word comes from Middle English
            travailen,
            travelen
            (which means to torment, labor, strive, journey) and earlier from Old French travailler (which means to work
            strenuously, toil). In English we still occasionally use the words "travail", which means struggle.
            According to
            Simon Winchester in his book The Best Travelers' Tales (2004), the words "travel" and "travail" both share
            an
            even more ancient root: a Romaninstrument of torture called the tripalium (in Latin it means "three stakes",
            as
            in to impale). This link may reflect the extreme difficulty of travel in ancient times. Today, travel may or
            may
            not be much easier depending upon the destination you choose (e.g. Mt. Everest, the Amazon rainforest), how
            you
            plan to get there (tour bus, cruise ship, or oxcart), and whether you decide to "rough it" (see extreme
            tourism
            and adventure travel). "There's a big difference between simply being a tourist and being a true world
            traveler", notes travel writer Michael Kasum. This is, however, a contested distinction as academic work on
            the
            cultures and sociology of travel has noted.
