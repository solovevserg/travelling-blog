        Travel is the movement of people between distant geographical locations. Travel can be done by foot, bicycle,
        automobile, train, boat, bus, airplane, ship or other means, with or without luggage, and can be one way or
        round
        trip. Travel can also include relatively short stays between successive movements.

    <h2>Etymology</h2>
    <p>
        The origin of the word "travel" is most likely lost to history. The term "travel" may originate from the Old
        French word travail, which means 'work'. According to the <b>Merriam Webster</b> dictionary, the first known use
        of the word travel was in the 14th century. It also states that the word comes from Middle English travailen,
        travelen
        (which means to torment, labor, strive, journey) and earlier from Old French travailler (which means to work
        strenuously, toil). In English we still occasionally use the words "travail", which means struggle. According to
        Simon Winchester in his book The Best Travelers' Tales (2004), the words "travel" and "travail" both share an
        even more ancient root: a Romaninstrument of torture called the tripalium (in Latin it means "three stakes", as
        in to impale). This link may reflect the extreme difficulty of travel in ancient times. Today, travel may or may
        not be much easier depending upon the destination you choose (e.g. Mt. Everest, the Amazon rainforest), how you
        plan to get there (tour bus, cruise ship, or oxcart), and whether you decide to "rough it" (see extreme tourism
        and adventure travel). "There's a big difference between simply being a tourist and being a true world
        traveler", notes travel writer Michael Kasum. This is, however, a contested distinction as academic work on the
        cultures and sociology of travel has noted.
