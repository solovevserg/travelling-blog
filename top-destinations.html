            Travel is the movement of people between distant geographical locations. Travel can be done by foot,
            bicycle,
            automobile, train, boat, bus, airplane, ship or other means, with or without luggage, and can be one way or
            round
            trip. Travel can also include relatively short stays between successive movements.

                <td>The opening credits of the show feature the iconic falls that seem remote, but in reality are easily
                    accessible. Less
                    than an hour's drive from downtown Seattle, Snoqualmie, Washington is a Twin Peaks wonderland and
                    home to Snoqualmie
                    Falls. The 270-foot waterfall is one of Washington state’s most-visited tourist attractions with
                    more than 1.5 million
                    visitors per year. If you go, go early so you can beat the crowds and get that iconic shot of the
                    falls with The Great
                    Northern Hotel in the background. Parking and admission are free. There are two observation
                    platforms. The top area is
                    an easy walk from the parking lot, but the lower area requires a hike. Be sure to bring a rain
                    jacket and poncho and
                    accept that you will get wet. The mist off the waterfall is incredibly powerful. Use a waterproof
                    sport camera or at
                    least take a waterproof phone case.

                    falls, is a luxury
                    hotel in real life. The Salish Lodge and Spa is the premiere hotel in Snoqualmie and even if you
                    can’t stay overnight,
                    you have to visit their gift shop for a treasure trove of Twin Peaks inspired goodies, such as local
                    coffee, local
                    cherry pie filling, owl knick knacks, and log pillows. Oh, and yes, you can stay in room 315, though
                    the interiors for
                    The Great Northern Hotel were filmed in upstate Washington at Kiana Lodge in Poulsbo, Washington for
                    the pilot and later
                    recreated on a soundstage in L.A.
